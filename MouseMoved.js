/*  
    use the MovingEye class to create the object(s) for the eye(s)
    There are 3 parameters:
    1) The ID of the svg/outer eye which contains the iris
    2) The ID of the iris which will move
    3) The maximum percentage the iris can move in the outer eye
    e.g.
        LeftEye = new MovingEye('SVGRoot', 'layer1', 20);
        RightEye = new MovingEye('SVGRoot1', 'layer1', 20);

    Then set mousemoved to be called for each eye when the mouse is moved
    the mouse coordinates are the 2 required parameters
    e.g.
        document.onmousemove = function(){
            LeftEye.mousemoved(event.clientX, event.clientY);
            RightEye.mousemoved(event.clientX, event.clientY);
        }
